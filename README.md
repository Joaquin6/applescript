Applescripts.
============

This repository serves as a collection/library of personal applescripts. In creating this library, I wanted to make these scripts universal rather than application specific, however many of them are specific to my needs.

## Links/Dependencies

- [Caffeine App](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) (or [here](http://macdownload.informer.com/caffeine)) - a menu bar application that prevents your monitor from sleeping. (If you don't want an extra application in your menubar, here is [a different way](http://lifehacker.com/5767991/how-to-force-your-mac-to-stay-awake-indefinitely-via-the-command-line), and if you're on 10.8+ [you can go ahead and use this command](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man8/caffeinate.8.html). Both work via ```do shell script```.)
- [Location Helper](http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/LocationHelper.html) - use core location in applescripts.
- [Twitter Scripter](http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/TwitterScripter.html) - interact with twitter via applescript.
- [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) and [Textutil](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/textutil.1.html) - document conversion via the command line.
- <s>`Youtube-Post.scpt` requires [GoogleCL](https://code.google.com/p/googlecl/), which is also useful for blogger, google calendar, and contacts</s>
	- GoogleCL is sadly defunct. Any associated scripts remain for posterity.
- I have also created a few [Gists](https://gist.github.com/unforswearing) for more specific applescript/bash related tasks.
- Also, check out my [Alfred Workflows](https://github.com/unforswearing/alfredWorkflows), including [dued](https://github.com/unforswearing/dued), which may be my favorite creation.
